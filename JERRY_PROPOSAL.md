# 🎡⚡ Zap Bot - Stream Automation for Jerry

Hey Jerry! Here's the system I mentioned that could automate your wheel spin zaps and make your streams way easier to manage.

## 🤔 The Problem You Have Now
- After each stream, you manually send zaps to every winner one by one
- You have to keep track of everyone's Speed usernames by hand
- It takes forever and you might miss someone or make mistakes
- Viewers have to trust you'll remember to send their zaps later

## ✨ What This System Would Do

### **For Your Viewers (Super Simple)**
1. You share one link in your stream chat
2. Viewers click it and enter just 2 things:
   - Their name (how they want to appear on your stream)
   - Their Speed username (like "john123")
3. That's it! They're registered for the wheel

### **For You (Much Easier)**
1. You get an admin panel that shows everyone who checked in
2. When you spin the wheel and call out a winner, you just:
   - Click their name in the list
   - Set the zap amount (1000 sats, 5000 sats, whatever)
   - Hit "Send Zap" - **BOOM, sent instantly!**
3. No more writing down names or sending zaps after the stream

## 🎯 Live Demo Flow

**Before Stream:**
- You create a session: "Jerry's Friday Night Wheel"
- System gives you 2 links: one for viewers, one for your admin panel

**During Stream:**
- "Hey everyone, click this link to get on the wheel!" 
- Viewers check in throughout the stream
- Your admin panel shows the live count: "47 people checked in"

**When You Spin:**
- Physical wheel lands on someone
- You look at your admin panel, click their name
- "Congrats Sarah! Sending you 2000 sats right now..."
- *Click* - zap sent instantly to their Speed wallet
- Everyone sees you're legit because it's immediate

## 💰 How Zaps Would Work

**Option 1: Dedicated Stream Wallet**
- We create a new Speed account just for streaming
- You top it up before each stream (like putting $50 in)
- System sends zaps from this account during the stream
- You control how much goes in, so you can't overspend

**Option 2: Your Main Account**
- Connect your existing Speed account (if you're comfortable)
- System sends zaps directly from your wallet

I'd recommend Option 1 - keeps it separate and you have full control over the budget.

## 🚀 Benefits for You

- **Save Hours:** No more manual zapping after streams
- **Look More Professional:** Instant zaps make you look super legit
- **Less Mistakes:** System tracks everything automatically
- **Better Engagement:** Viewers get excited seeing instant payouts
- **Scale Up:** Could easily handle 100+ people on the wheel

## 🛠 Technical Stuff (Don't Worry About This)

- Web app hosted on Vercel (free, reliable)
- Works on all devices (phone, computer, tablet)
- Real-time updates so you see check-ins live
- Simple interface - no complicated setup needed

## 💡 Future Ideas (If You Like It)

- Digital wheel that viewers can see on screen
- Automatic random winner selection
- Different wheel tiers (bronze/silver/gold)
- Integration with your streaming software
- Analytics on engagement and zap history

## 🤷 What Do You Think?

**Questions for you:**
1. Does this solve the right problem for you?
2. Would your viewers use something this simple?
3. Are you comfortable with the Speed wallet setup?
4. What zap amounts do you usually send? (so I can set good defaults)
5. Anything missing that would make this perfect?

**Next Steps:**
If this sounds useful, I can build out the Speed API integration and get you a working demo in a couple days. If not, no worries - just wanted to see if it would actually help your workflow!

Let me know what you think! 🙏
